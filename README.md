**Project Title: Amazon Product Web Scraping Using Python**

**Description**

This project involves building a web scraper to extract essential product details from Amazon, such as the product title, price, rating, and number of reviews. The goal was to automate the data collection process for analysis or to track price changes over time. The scraper is built using Python and several key libraries, enabling it to navigate the Amazon website, gather product information, and store it for further use.

**About the Project**

In this project, I developed a Python-based web scraper to automate the extraction of product data from Amazon. Leveraging the power of libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests, and SMTP, the scraper effectively retrieves key information including product title, price, ratings, and reviews. The data can be used for market analysis, price monitoring, or tracking changes over time. Additionally, the project incorporates time and datetime modules for scheduling tasks, and an email notification feature to alert users about significant price drops.

**Key Technologies**

•	Python: The core programming language used to develop the scraper.

•	BeautifulSoup: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents to extract the necessary information.

•	Requests: Handles HTTP requests to interact with the Amazon website.

•	Time & Datetime: Used for managing delays and scheduling scraping tasks.

•	SMTPLib: Enables sending automated email notifications based on specific conditions (e.g., price drops).
